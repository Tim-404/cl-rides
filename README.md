## Configurations
In the `cfg` directory, you will find the file `map.txt`.
Additionally, you can add `ignore_drivers.txt` and/or `ignore_riders.txt` to the `cfg` directory.

### ignore_drivers.txt and ignore_riders.txt
Add the phone numbers of the people you want to exclude in the next run of the program, separated by `\n`, or **ENTER**.

### map.txt
This tells the program how different pickup locations are situated around each other.
The syntax is as follows.
- `<loc>` : Every location must match how it is used in the Google Forms
  - `Revelle` is accepted, `revelle` is not.
- `#` : Lines starting with `#` are ignored as comments.
- `,` : Locations separated by `,` are considered to be in the same area.
- `\n` or **ENTER** : The number of **ENTER**s denotes how far apart two areas are.
- `ELSEWHERE` : Represents locations not hardcoded into the script. Used for handling exact addresses and unknown locations.
